# GitHub Workflow Instructions

1. Create a GitHub repository.  
2. Invite me as a collaborator.  
3. Set your tasks as folders in the repo. Example:  
   - `1_Week1_Reading`  
   - `2_Lab_1`  
4. Your slides for the reading assignment go into `1_Week1_Reading`.  
5. Your solutions for Lab 1 go into `2_Lab_1`, etc.  
6. To commit your work:  
   - For every task (e.g., Assignment or Lab), create a branch in your repo and commit to this branch.  
   - Example: To commit the reading assignment, create a branch called `week1_reading` and commit your work to this branch.  
7. Commit your work to the branch.  
8. Create a Pull Request on that branch and assign me as the reviewer.  
   - In the PR, indicate that once the review is approved, the branch should merge to `main` automatically.  
9. Once I review, your work will be merged into your `main` branch.  
10. Every assignment and task will follow this same workflow:  
    - Create a branch  
    - Solve the task  
    - Commit to that branch  
    - Open a Pull Request  
    - Assign me as a reviewer  
    - Once approved, it merges into `main` automatically.
